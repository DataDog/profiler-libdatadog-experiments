#
# Based on existing span-based instrumentation
#
# Benefits:
# - General visibility into what metadata populates each field
# - Adding tags
# - Modifying tags (with static values, or other tag values)
# - Removing tags
#
# Limitations:
# - Data must be a tag on the span at time of the snapshot
# - No arbitrary interpolation (tokens only)
